Follow the steps to run the server:
-> Make sure you have the necessary dependies installed:
	npm install express body-parser
	npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node @types/express ts-node nodemon
-> Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the server files lie. (You could right click on the directory and open terminal).
-> Run the command 'npm run dev' 
-> This will start the server
-> Now you may proceed to run the windows forms application.
